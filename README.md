## Audio System

### Procedural Sound Generation
This game features a **completely original audio system** built from scratch using the **Web Audio API**:

- **No external audio files** - All sounds are generated procedurally
- **Real-time synthesis** - Sawtooth wave oscillators create retro sci-fi sounds
- **Dynamic music** - Tempo and musical scales change based on game level
- **Multi-layered composition** - Bass, melody, and harmony generated algorithmically

### Music System Features
- **6 Musical Scales** - Each level has its own key signature and mood
- **Dynamic Tempo** - BPM increases from 120 to 220 as you level up
- **Procedural Generation** - Music composed in real-time using mathematical algorithms
- **Volume Control** - Background music at optimal volume levels
- **Mute Toggle** - Press "M" to toggle all audio

### Sound Effects
- **Shooting sounds** - Generated sawtooth waves with envelope shaping
- **Explosion effects** - Noise synthesis with frequency sweeps
- **Power-up sounds** - Ascending frequency patterns
- **All procedural** - No pre-recorded audio files required
